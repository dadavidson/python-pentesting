# Arpscan

Unlike traditional network scanners that depend upon ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to identify hosts on a network this Python script instead utilizes ARP. ICMP packets can be monitored or systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests at all. These are a few reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify hosts on a local network is more effective.

usage: 
```
python3 arpscan.py interface ipaddress/cidr
```

example: 
```
python3 arpscan.py 10.10.10.10/24 eth0
```
